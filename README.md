# Tunneler TNT

**Tunneler TNT** is a vanilla-friendly expansion mod for Minecraft (Fabric) that adds specialized explosives to your arsenal.
Designed to fit seamlessly into the base game, these new TNT types offer powerful utility for mining and excavation without feeling out of place.

## 🧨 Features

### 1. Heavy TNT
A dense, high-power explosive designed for massive excavation.
* **Explosion Power:** 7.0 (nearly double vanilla TNT).
* **Fuse Time:** 6 Seconds (120 ticks) — gives you extra time to clear the blast zone.
* **Behavior:** Works exactly like standard TNT, just bigger and louder.

### 2. Tunneler TNT
A specialized directional charge used for rapid mining and breaching.
* **Directional:** Carves a tunnel *forward* based on the direction it was facing when placed.
* **Dimensions:** Creates a 16-block long tunnel with a radius of 4 blocks.
* **Smart Mining:** * **Ore Safety:** Automatically detects and *ignores* precious blocks (Ores, Ancient Debris, Spawners, Chests), leaving them floating safely in the air.
    * **Natural Look:** Uses a noise algorithm to create rough, cave-like walls instead of perfect mathematical cylinders.

## 🛠️ Mechanics & Recipes

**Progression:**
The mod integrates naturally with survival progression.
* Recipes are **hidden** by default.
* **Unlock Condition:** Simply obtain a block of **Vanilla TNT** to automatically unlock the recipes for both Heavy and Tunneler TNT in your recipe book.

**Crafting:**
* **Heavy TNT:** Reinforced with extra Gunpowder (Gunpowder - TNT - Gunpowder).
* **Tunneler TNT:** Directed using Iron Nuggets and Gunpowder.

## ⚖️ Philosophy
The goal is simple:
- Keep everything feeling like "Vanilla+" (items that feel like Mojang could have added them).
- Add variants that behave naturally in the world.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or "magical" behavior.

## 🤝 Contributing

If you want to help develop the mod:
- The codebase is intentionally simple and readable.
- New TNT types follow the standard Fabric Entity pattern.
- All behavior is built on top of normal TNT logic so it’s easy to extend.

**Ways you can contribute:**
- Add new TNT variants.
- Improve textures or models.
- Suggest balance changes.
- Report bugs or odd interactions.

Pull Requests are welcome. Keep changes clean, focused, and consistent with the vanilla-like style.
