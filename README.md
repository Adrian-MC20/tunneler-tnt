# Tunneler TNT

Tunneler TNT is a small expansion mod for Minecraft that adds new types of TNT with unique behaviors.  
Everything is designed to feel close to vanilla, just more powerful or more specialized.

## What the Mod Adds

### Mega TNT
A stronger, larger version of regular TNT.

- Much bigger explosion
- Longer fuse time so you can actually run away
- Works exactly like normal TNT (redstone, flint & steel, chain reactions)

More TNT types will be added next:
- Directional / Horizontal TNT (burrows forward in a cone)
- Napalm TNT (sets everything on fire without destroying blocks)
- Tunneler TNT (digs straight lines)

## Philosophy
The goal is simple:
- Keep everything feeling like vanilla TNT
- Add new variants that behave naturally in the world
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or magical behavior

If it feels like “Minecraft would have added this”, we’re doing it right.

## Contributing

If you want to help develop the mod:
- The codebase is intentionally simple and readable
- New TNT types follow the same basic pattern as Mega TNT
- All behavior is built on top of normal TNT logic so it’s easy to extend

Ways you can contribute:
- Add new TNT variants
- Improve textures or models
- Suggest balance changes
- Help document explosion behaviors
- Report bugs or odd interactions

Pull Requests are welcome. Keep changes clean, focused, and consistent with the vanilla-like style.
